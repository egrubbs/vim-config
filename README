vim-config
=============

Contents
--------
    check_vimrc/
        This directory contains scripts that help you verify that your
        .vimrc file is loading everything correctly.
    personal/
        Here are configs that are relevant to development on Launchpad's
        code base. Other Canonical projects could create top level
        directories for their settings.
    share/
        Here is where re-usable or 3rd party vim configs go. The project
        specific directories, such as 'personal', will then load items
        from the 'share' directory.
    testing/
        Libraries used to run vim unit tests. Tests are located in
        personal/tests and share/tests.

Dependencies
------------

These vim settings and plugins have been tested on VIM 7.2. You will
also need the vim-python package.

The pocketlint vim plugin depends on having pocketlint installed.
   https://launchpad.net/pocket-lint


Installation
------------

Normally, you will put this branch in $HOME/.vim/vim-config, but you
could put vim-config in any other directory in your runtimepath. (To
find out more, start vim and enter the command ":help runtimepath")

Load all personal configs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you have placed the vim-config directory, you can load all the configs
by adding the following line to your $HOME/.vimrc file.

    runtime vim-config/personal/all.vim

Load specific configs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't like all the settings, you can load the personal/standard.vim or
the .vim files in the personal/optional directory like so:

    runtime vim-config/personal/standard.vim
    runtime vim-config/personal/optional/python_ctrl_p_format_import.vim

If you want to load all the filetype specific settings in personal/ftdetect
and personal/ftplugin, you will need to add vim-config/personal to the
runtimepath.

    set runtimepath+=$HOME/.vim/vim-config/launchpad

If you only want to use some of the filetype specific configs, you could
symlink files in personal/ftdetect to $HOME/.vim/ftdetect and symlink files
from personal/ftplugin to $HOME/.vim/ftplugin.

Checking that the configs are being loaded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you have edited your .vimrc, you can run
vim-config/check_vimrc/loaded.sh to see which global .vim files were
loaded.

You can run vim-config/check_vimrc/ftplugin.sh to see whether vim will load
the filetype specific settings in personal/ftplugin when a file of that type
is edited.


Testing
-------

You can run all the tests with the command:
    make test
